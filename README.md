# ShopifyApp

This app is meant to help business owners easily create product pages on Shopify which allow customers to create custom products, a feature which is notably missing from Shopify's default product page creator. Examples of possible uses would include custom skateboard building, custom PC building, customized chairs, and more. The app can be used whenever a product has interchangeable parts.
The app was built using React.js and Next.js. It uses GraphQL to query the Shopify API to retrieve user account information (products, prices, images, ect.).
